 The Following are done:
 ```
 a) Generate a random 128 bit key (16 characters) using ascii characters.
 b) Use AES (CBC mode) for the encryption process with the random key mentioned at the beginning.
 c) Generate a Public/Private key-pair using RSA.
 d) Save the key used in (b) to desktop in a .key format named "Key.key".
 e) Find all .txt Files in Windows System and save their paths to "file.txt"
 f) save the public/private key to a file on the desktop "keyPair.key"
 g) encrypt the 16char key with the public key
 h) save the encrypted 16char to a file on the desktop "encryptedKey.key"
 i) send the encrypted 16char key to the server
 j) access the csv file and extrace emails from it
 ```
